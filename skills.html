		<h2>Skills Required:</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>The most important skill for any psychologist, especially those dealing with patients directly, is that of communication, which is required in order to properly describe observations either within studies or within patients, as well as to clarify their meaning.</li>
		<li>Problem-solving is also a major skill needed by any psychologist looking to enter the field, since the determination of treatment plans is a big deal, and something that cannot be messed up. Psychologists will often have to observe or hear of behavioral patterns and utilize problem-solving skills in order to prescribe proper treatments or provide the most helpful service.</li>
		<li>Another major skill partically focused towards psychologists that directly deal with patients is boundary-setting. Boundary-setting is very important since an overstep on the part of the psychologist can lead to a patient's situation worsening rather than improving. Knowing where to set proper boundaries is also deeply rooted in empathy for the patient.</li>
		<li>As a psychologist, one must always remain patient, since each patient will likely have different struggles, and some may struggle to explain their thinking and feelings more than others. If a psychologist were to lose their patience, it can damage their relationships with patients, and could also cause problems with their determination of the situation and proper treatment.</li>
		<li>The final one of the most important skills for a psychologist is that of open-mindedness. Everyone holds opinions of situations, but as a psychologist, one must push these opinions to the back of their minds and focus on the issue at hand, without allowing any of their personal biased to get through, or it could be devastating to not only the situation, but also the patient being affected.</li>
